# Private Social Graph
![image](../static/img/visible_world.png)

A social graph is the representation of relations between accounts, either directly or via another account.
In a private social graph, an account has visibility to a subset of the graph (**visible world**) through its relationships. No one has access to the global graph (**big world**), not even the hubs.


**Account & Search:**

Account in the center, representing a person in the real world, who has relationships with people around them, has access to members of the community they are part of, and contacts shared by their connections.
An account is a node in the graph. Search originates from the account & traverses outwards via relationships to find people and their profiles covering the visible world. 

**Community:**

A community is an account that maintains a member directory, which is shared with all the member accounts when they “join” the community. This allows accounts to discover other accounts via a shared community.
